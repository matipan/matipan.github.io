      <description>This is the second post in a series of blog posts that look at Dagger from different perspectives. In this post we do a deep dive on how to leverage Dagger as a developer that is tasked with implementing the CI process of a Java-Gradle service. In this CI process we need to: build, run integration tests with external dependencies and package the service. We will leave the CD part for a future blog post that looks at Dagger from the perspective of a Platform Engineer/SRE.</description>

      <description>Dagger is a new tool that promises to fix the yaml and custom scripts mess that CI/CD currently is by building pipelines as code with one of the supported SDKs. I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of learning this tool, understanding where it may fall short and where it shines and I decided that sharing some of the exploration I do and the learnings it leaves me with would be useful. This is the first post in a series of blog posts that look at Dagger from different perspectives.</description>
