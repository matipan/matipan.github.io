      <description>The title says it, motion tracking turret using only Go, ready to have some func?
This blog post will be divided into three main parts: Motion detection with GoCV, Controlling servo motors with Gobot and Putting it all together. In the first part, we build a lightweight motion detection algorithm that can run on low-power devices such as the RPi. In the second part we will show how to control servo motors with Gobot from the Raspberry Pi and in the last part we&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to go from detecting an object on an image to telling exactly the angles in which the servos need to move in order to track it.</description>
