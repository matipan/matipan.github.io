      <description>Disclaimer: this blog post is just a port of Adrian&amp;rsquo;s tutorial at pyimagesearch where he shows how to track a ball using Python and OpenCV. I only changed a few things here and there and rewrote it using Go and GoCV. So all the credit should go to him
I always prefer to start by showing what you&amp;rsquo;ll get if you stick to the end, so here it goes:
Hooked? Awesome.</description>

      <description>The title says it, motion tracking turret using only Go, ready to have some func?
This blog post will be divided into three main parts: Motion detection with GoCV, Controlling servo motors with Gobot and Putting it all together. In the first part, we build a lightweight motion detection algorithm that can run on low-power devices such as the RPi. In the second part we will show how to control servo motors with Gobot from the Raspberry Pi and in the last part we&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to go from detecting an object on an image to telling exactly the angles in which the servos need to move in order to track it.</description>
