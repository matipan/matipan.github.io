      <description>Dagger is a new tool that promises to fix the yaml and custom scripts mess that CI/CD currently is by building pipelines as code with one of the supported SDKs. I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of learning this tool, understanding where it may fall short and where it shines and I decided that sharing some of the exploration I do and the learnings it leaves me would be useful.
NOTE: Dagger is in very active development so by the time you read this blog post it might already be deprecated.</description>
