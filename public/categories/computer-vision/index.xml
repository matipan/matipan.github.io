      <description>There is a new term in town that has been making its way to all of us for a couple of years now: Serverless. When I first heard this I was kind of confused as to what it meant. Everybody seemed to have an opinion about it but there were no real answers. The following definition from serverless-stack helped me clarify a bit:
Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: this blog post is just a port of Adrian&amp;rsquo;s tutorial at pyimagesearch where he shows how to track a ball using Python and OpenCV. I only changed a few things here and there and rewrote it using Go and GoCV. So all the credit should go to him
I always prefer to start by showing what you&amp;rsquo;ll get if you stick to the end, so here it goes:
Hooked? Awesome.</description>

      <title>Motion tracking turret with Gobot and GoCV - Part 1</title>

      <description>The title says it, motion tracking turret using only Go, ready to have some func?
This blog post will be divided into three main parts: Motion detection with GoCV, Controlling servo motors with Gobot and Putting it all together. In the first part, we build a lightweight motion detection algorithm that can run on low-power devices such as the RPi. In the second part we will show how to control servo motors with Gobot from the Raspberry Pi and in the last part we&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to go from detecting an object on an image to telling exactly the angles in which the servos need to move in order to track it.</description>
